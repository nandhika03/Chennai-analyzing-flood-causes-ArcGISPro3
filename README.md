# Chennai-analyzing-flood-causes-ArcGISPro3

Chennai, the capital of Tamil Nadu, is situated along the Bay of Bengal on India's southeast 
coast. Chennai, a city well-known for its thriving culture, extensive history, and economic 
importance, is vital to India's urban and coastal dynamics. Chennai is a bustling Indian metropolis 
that has experienced tremendous change because of increased urbanization. With an emphasis on 
elevation dynamics, changes in land use and land cover, and the effects of reservoirs converted 
into rooftops, this study explores the changing link between urban expansion and vulnerability. 
The project investigates how Chennai's increased danger of floods is a result of land transformation 
and urbanization through a combination of historical insights and GIS analytics. Using various 
data models and analysis methods, the study seeks to pinpoint the main causes of flood 
susceptibility. "When land forgets its water, water remembers its land" is the subject that captures 
the findings, which highlight the difficult balance between development and sustainability.
