# 🌊 Chennai: Analyzing Flood Causes Using ArcGIS Pro 3 🗺️

Hello, everyone! 👋

Being a data science graduate student, I decided to dive into GIS and Spatial Analysis during my second semester. The thought of learning something beyond coding and algorithms made me very excited. I chose the course, and the professor, Mickey Jarvi, at Michigan Technological University, was just awesome! 🎓

As part of the class, I worked on this semester-long final project, which was incredibly cool to do. 🚀

## 💡 Project Inspiration:
I doubted myself a lot before starting the project. Finding GIS datasets was a big challenge for me. 🤔 I didn't know where to look, what to search for, or what formats these datasets came in. I eventually used resources like:
- 🌍 **USGS Earth Explorer**
- 🛰️ **Google Earth**
- 🌧️ **CSIR for Rainfall Data**

I performed a flood simulation using rainfall data and other inputs, but I couldn't put everything together as cohesively as I wanted. 😅

## 🎤 Lightning Talk:
The [PowerPoint presentation](GIS_PPT.pdf) was for a 30-second lightning talk our professor assigned us in class. I was blown away by my fellow students' presentations they were amazing! ✨

---

## 🔨 Challenges Faced:
- 🌐 Struggled with finding GIS datasets.
- 🖼️ Learned to use Landsat satellite imagery.
- 🕒 Endured 4-hour lab sessions with GCPs and digitizing tasks. 😩

---

## 🌟 Key Takeaways:
- After hours of effort, I now feel confident about finding GIS datasets and working with spatial tools. 🛠️
- It feels great to have accomplished something so rewarding! 💪

## 🏙️ Why Chennai? 
Our professor asked us to choose a topic personal to us. I chose Chennai's flooding because:
- I was there during the **December 2023 floods**. 🌧️
- I experienced walking chest-deep in water, with my interview canceled and nowhere to go. 🚶‍♂️💦

This project aims to show why this flooding happens, through a very basic analysis. I hope to extend this into an urban planning project someday. 🌆

---

## 📈 Future Scope:
Whenever I can, I will try to build on this project and include more sophisticated simulations and urban planning analyses.

### 🚀 Happy Mapping! 🗺️
